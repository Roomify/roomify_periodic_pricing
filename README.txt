INTRODUCTION
============
Define weekly and monthly pricing rates quickly with the ability to vary them throughout the year. 

The Roomify Period Pricing modules allows a user to easily define default amounts for weekly/monthly pricing that can change over time and provides an enchanced calendar timeline view to allow you to change rates for either nighty, weekly or monthly rates by dragging and selecting dates on a calendar.

All-in-all it is a significant overhaul of the Rooms standard weekly/monthly functionality for websites that require more fine-tuned control of their rates.
